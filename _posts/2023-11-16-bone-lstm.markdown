This study uses an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model to extract features from ÂµCT images, enabling the classification of bone samples by sex, age, and alcohol consumption status in humans and rhesus macaques. The LSTM-derived features allowed moderate classification accuracy for sex, with 72% accuracy in macaques and 65.5% in humans, while distinctions based on alcohol consumption were less pronounced
