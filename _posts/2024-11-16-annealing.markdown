The paper presents an annealing-based technique to speed up Hamerly’s and Elkan’s k-means algorithms by skipping distance calculations for points less likely to change assignments. Experimental results show that this technique can reduce execution time by up to 15% without compromising clustering quality, especially in high-dimensional datasets
