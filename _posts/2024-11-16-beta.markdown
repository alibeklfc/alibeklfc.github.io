The paper proposes Beta k-means and Beta Hamerly k-means algorithms, which use probabilistic filtering with a beta distribution to skip unnecessary distance calculations during clustering. These methods show faster convergence than traditional k-means, Hamerly, and Annulus algorithms, especially with high-dimensional data, without sacrificing clustering quality
